If you really want a Debian package of it, file a RFP or wishlist bug.

Fonts and locales
-----------------

For full unicode, you need a lot of glyphs. Since many old fonts only include
glyphs for ASCII or ISO-8859-*, this is a major problem. X11 does therefor use
multiple fonts to combine them to a FontSet. Most of the time you needn't have
a full set of all unicode glyphs, but only use a small subset. This subset
depends on your locale setting, which specified which glyphs must be available
for a FontSet to be complete.

Therefor you should use wildcards in your font-specification, else X11 might
not be able to find all required glyphs and doen't create a font at all. It's
a good idea to install additional fonts with other encodings, for example, the
xfonts-{75dpi,100dpi,base}-transcoded are a good idea.

If it still doesn't work, try to revert back to an non-UTF8 (LANG=de_DE)
encoding or use good old ASCII (LANG=C).
